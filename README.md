# Ojas---Dynamic-and-Transparent-Train-Seat-Allocation-using-Firebase
It is an android app developed for dynamic and transparent allocation of train seats.In present time, railway tickets can be booked till 3 - 4 hours before the departure of train. We are proposing the dynamic seat allocation system in which tickets can be booked even after the departure of the train in case of ticket availability. If someone is found to be absent at his/her seat, his/her ticket will be cancelled and same will be allotted to Waiting list passengers and will be opened for fresh booking in case of zero Waiting List. For transparency, Android app will be used to check the tickets and confirmation SMS will be sent to passenger's mobile on allotting the seats or cancellation of tickets.  Technology used : Android, Firebase Software used : Android Studio
